For X(3872) and Psi(2S):
    sideband : [3.6,3.66] && [3.72,3.83] && [3.91,4.0]
    MC X and PSI has a signal region cut([3.66,3.72],[3.83,3.91]), data doesn't
    cut0: B_chi2cl > 0.003 && B_Qvalueuj < 0.2 && Bmass [3.6,4.0]
    cut1: B_chi2cl > 0.005 && B_Qvalueuj < 0.2


For B mesons:
    sideband Bu : [5.0,5.2] && [5.4,6.0]
    sideband Bs : [5.0,5.3] && [5.44,6.0]
    pre-selection : Bnorm_svpvDistance>2

    for now, MC doesn't have signal mass window

    cut0: B_chi2cl > 0.003 && B_Qvalueuj < 0.2
